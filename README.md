# CookwareKingdom
CookwareKingdom is a Laravel-based online store project focused on the good practices of software development and coding.

## About the project
This project developed by Royal Sharks is a simulation of a kitchenware store, complete with related recipes. It offers user registration and login features, allowing users to add products to a shopping cart for future purchases or cancel them if necessary. Upon purchasing items from the shopping cart, the order details are provided on the order view, where users can download the order information in CSV/PDF format.

Users can also check out two microservices implemented on the project, those microservices being: a [weather update](Weather API - OpenWeatherMap) and information about movies from a page developed by another team.

If the user logs in as a page administrator, they will be provided with all the options above but including access to the admin view, in said view administrators can create, edit, and delete both products and recipes.
